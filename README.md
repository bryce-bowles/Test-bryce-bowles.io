Learning to create a webpage to display my projects and thoughts. I will try to keep this updated. 


__________

Notes: 
A landing page with some brief information about you and some references to the other areas of your website.

A portfolio page that provides an overview of your projects. Add short descriptions and links to your code, blog posts and the websites that host them.

An about page where you can talk about your qualifications, your educational background, your skills or anything else you want your audience to know about you.

A blog section/page that either contains your blog posts on your website or that links to your Medium profile, for example.

A section on contact details and your online presence. Add links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, Kaggle, Twitter or any other online profiles that may be relevant to your websiteâ€™s audience.
